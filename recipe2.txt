Mix the dry ingredients. Pour the dry mix into an airtight container and store in the fridge for later. Or
you can start cooking them now. Place the dry ingredients in a large bowl and make a well at the bottom with
a spoon. Warm the milk, melt the butter. Place milk and butter in a small pot and warm gently over low heat.
You just need to melt the butter and bring the mixture up to about 104 Â°F, which is the perfect temperature
for waking up the yeast in the next step. When the milk mixture is at the proper temperature, add egg and
whisk to combine. Pour the milk mixture into the well you created in the dry mix. Use a whisk to combine
the ingredients and make batter. Allow this mixture to sit at room temp or warmer to allow the yeast to bloom.
You can bloom the yeast for as little as ten minutes or up to two hours. Pour the mixture into a preheated
nonstick waffle iron. You may have to play with the time and temperature, as each waffle maker will be 
a little different. You want a nice, golden, crispy crust and a soft and almost custardy interior. Top with
your favorite fruits.
